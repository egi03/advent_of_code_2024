## 🚀 How to Run

Each day contains Python solutions that can be run independently:

```bash
# Run a specific day's solution
cd day1
python day1_part1.py
python day1_part2.py
```

### 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Standard library modules (no external dependencies for most solutions)
- Some days use additional libraries:
  - `numpy` (Day 13)
  - `PIL` (Day 14 part 2 - for visualization)
  - `tqdm` (Day 11 - for progress bars)

### 📝 Input Files

Input files are gitignored for copyright reasons. To run the solutions:

1. Download your personal input from [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)
2. Save as `input.txt` in the respective day's folder
3. Run the Python scripts
